# Echocardiogram-Data-Analysis-Report
# Introduction
The dataset contains echocardiogram records of patients, which are crucial for understanding heart conditions and potential risks. This report analyzes key features such as age, survival status, heart measurements, and their implications.

# Data Overview
Total Records: 131
Features: 13 (including age, survival status, heart condition metrics)
Missing Values: Some columns have missing values, with group missing the most (57 missing entries).
# Key Statistics and Findings
# 1. Age:
Mean Age: 22.18 years
Range: 0.03 - 57 years
Most patients are relatively young, with the majority under 30.

# 2. Survival and Still Alive Status:
Survival Rate: 32.8% survived.
Alive Status Average Age: 62.81 years (indicating survival status might refer to different age metrics or data inconsistencies).

# 3. Heart Condition Metrics:
Pericardial Effusion: 21.7% mean value, indicating mild to moderate effusion.
Fractional Shortening: Mean at 12.16%, with some cases as high as 40%.
E-point Septal Separation (EPSS): Mean 4.76 mm, indicating various degrees of heart function.
LVDD (Left Ventricular Diastolic Dimension): Mean 14.44 mm, critical for assessing heart size and function.
Wall Motion Score and Index: Measures the overall movement of the heart wall, with mean scores indicating minor abnormalities.

# 4. Data Quality and Anomalies:
There are inconsistencies in the data, particularly with missing values and some rows not fitting the expected schema.

# Visualizations and Insights
Visualizations such as histograms for age distribution, box plots for fractional shortening, and scatter plots for the relationship between age and survival status can provide deeper insights.

# Conclusions and Recommendations
The dataset suggests that younger individuals with specific heart conditions are more prevalent. However, the dataset's inconsistencies and missing values highlight the need for careful preprocessing before any predictive modeling. Future work could focus on imputing missing values, standardizing metrics, and further exploring the relationships between different heart condition metrics and survival outcomes.
This summary provides an initial analysis. For a more comprehensive report, including detailed visualizations and more nuanced statistical analyses, further work is needed.
